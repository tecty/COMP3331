Diverage at 49.255.42.221
Or Diverage from a router group? BE-100.cor02.syd04.nsw.VOCUS.net.au 

49.255.42.221 is belong to VOCUS PTY LTD
BE-100.cor02.syd04.nsw.VOCUS.net.au is belong to Vocus Communications Ltd
Both is belong to vocus Communications which is a ISP for small ISP, in my point of view. 
There business is target to datacenter, ISP, etc. And they have national wide optical caples 
and cable go aboard.

I couldn't find out the geological location about both network

No, Uk is further than japan but I observed less hops in www.lancaster.ac.uk

3.
I choose speedtest.com.sg and telstra.net
No, they  didn't go through same  route. I haven't observe any ip is same, but it has a 
lots of router is belong to vocus. In my opinion, the router have load balancing. Furthermroe, 
the advantage of package routing is each package can choose the best route when they arrived to
router, which is one of the advantage of package switching.

Reasons
The phisycal wire couldn't be placed at the shortest path. The light or signal in the transfer 
medium won't neccessary as fast as light.
The Delay is the sum of {processing,queueing,transmission,propagation} dalay, no only the proprogation 
dalay, and all of the other dalay couldn't be 0

2. 
It vary over time, because there's a different waiting time (queueing delay) when the package go 
through a same router each time. So the sum of all the queueing dalay is vary from time to time.

3.
Depend on the package size: transmission delay
May depend on the package size: processing, if the processing is all base on software and has not 
accleration from hardware
Not depend on package size: {queueing, propagation} dalay
