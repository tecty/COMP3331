\section{Exercise 1}

\subsection{Question 1}

IP of gaia.cs.umass.edu: 128.119.245.12\\
It's using port 80. \\ 
Client is using IP:192.168.1.102 with port 1161\\

\subsection{Question 2}

Sequence number: 232129013

\subsection{Question 3}

First six segments are:\\
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Seq. No.& Sent time & Ack recv. Time & RTT (ms) & Estimated RTT (ms)\\
    232129013 & 1093095860.596858000 & 1093095860.624318000 & 2.74598598480225 & 2.74598598480225 \\
    232129578 & 1093095860.612118000 & 1093095860.647675000 & 3.55570316314697 & 2.84720063209534 \\
    232131038 & 1093095860.624407000 & 1093095860.694466000 & 7.00590610504150 & 3.36703881621361 \\
    232132498 & 1093095860.625071000 & 1093095860.739499000 & 11.4428043365479 & 4.37650950625539 \\
    232133958 & 1093095860.647786000 & 1093095860.787680000 & 13.9894008636475 & 5.57812092592940 \\
    232135418 & 1093095860.648538000 & 1093095860.838183000 & 18.9644813537598 & 7.25141597940819 \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Question 4}

Length is 17520.

\subsection{Question 5}

The minimal buffer size of server is 6780.
Yes it did. At the begin, the client send two segements at one time .
But after the windowsize become larger, the client sent 5 package at once.

\subsection{Question 6}

No, there's not retransimit. I put 
\begin{lstlisting}
    tcp.analysis.retransmission or tcp.analysis.fast_retransmission
\end{lstlisting}
at the filter field.

\subsection{Question 7}

It's acking 1460 Byte of data. 

The server didn't open the delay acking. So it ack for each package it received.
Which means I didn't identify the cases the receiver is acking every other received segment 
(delay acking).

\subsection{Question 8}

Start time: 0\\
End time: 7.595557\\
Start Seq: 232129012\\
End Seq: 232293103\\
Transfered Byte: 164091\\
Throughput (Byte/Second): 21603.55\\
Which is: 21.603 KB/s\\

\section{Exercise 2}

\subsection{Question 1}

For server, it's initiate at 2818463618.

\subsection{Question 2}

It's 1247095790. The ack filed is 2818463619. 
It's determined by the sequence number send from client as seq then ack as seq+1.

\subsection{Question 3}

Sequence number is 2818463619, Acknowlogement field of this ACK segment is 1247095791.
No, this segment doesn't contain any data.

\subsection{Question 4}

The client do the activeclose. The client has ip 10.9.16.201 which sent the FIN segment first.
No, this segment doesn't contain any data.

\subsection{Question 5}

From client to server:
2818463652-
2818463618-2 = 32
\\
From server to client: 
1247095831-
1247095790-2 =39

It's final ack - initial seq. number - 2. The reson for -2 is the ack for SYN and FIN will 
+1 for the sequence numer, but those package doesn't have any data.
