\section{Exercise 1}
\subsection{Question 1}

Node 0 and Node 2. \\
Node 0 communicate with 5 via 1,4.\\
Node 2 communicate with 5 via 3.\\ \\
Node 0 use: 0 - 1 - 4 - 5\\
Node 2 use: 2 - 3 - 5 \\
No, the route doesn't change over time.

\subsection{Quesiton 2}

The link 1 - 4 is down. No route between the communicating nodes changed. Hence some package from node 0 has lost.

\subsection{Question 3}

There's some additional traffic which is the router tell it's neighbour about it's distance vector. \\
The router 1 re-route the traffic from node 0 when the link 1 - 4 is down to node 2. 

\subsection{Question 4}

It affect the traffic from node 0 instead of taking link 1 - 4 by taking link 1 - 2. Because this change increase the cost between 1 - 4 from 1 to 3. This will make the cost of 1 - 4 - 5 become 4 while 1 - 2 - 3 - 5 is only 3. So, it's cheaper to take the route 1 - 2 - 3 - 5 by the distance vector algorithm, even the other route has less link to pass.

\subsection{Question 5}

Result: The traffic from node 2 take two route : 2 - 1 - 4 - 5 and 2 - 3 - 5 \\
Reason: The setting of multipath is true, and the node will use mutiple paths to any distination. After this setting, both 2 - 1 - 4 - 5 and 2 - 3 - 5 has same cost 4, so the node 2 chose two path to send it's traffic to node 5.
